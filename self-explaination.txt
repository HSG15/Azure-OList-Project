Create azure account

Create resource group (ecommerce-live)
Create resource Azure Data Factory (hsg-olist-ecomm-df) > Launch Studio
	Author > new Pipeline > Move and transforms > Copy Data (Source from GitHub)
Create resource storage account (ADLS Gen2) (hsgolistecommstorage)
	Data storage > Containers > olist-data (create new container)
        Inside container > add directory (medallion architecture) -> (gold, silver, bronze)
Now post data from data factory to storage (bronze), hich contains the raw data.

Connect to Azure Data Lake Storage - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/connect/storage/tutorial-azure-storage
1. Create a app registration
2. Certificate & secret > New client secret
3. Add role assignment (Storage Blob Data Contributor).



Retrieve Row data from Kaggle and import those into github repo.
One dataset is pushed to filess (free db hosting platform) mysql db.
Then made http request (github linked service) to retrieve those data in azure data factory and made an mysql linked service.
I created a JSON format of with csv_relative_url and file_name. and put this in a foreach loop to send data to my bronze file of ADLS gen2 and 
added another copy data which will trigger once the json data added into adls, whiere the source is sql and sink is adls.
Here Raw Data ingestion completed to ADLS GEN2 via Azure DF.



Then Connected adls to databricks where I process some data and again made a connection with MongoDB hosted on filess.io and initially pushed 
some data over there. In databricks i retrieve the data from files.io mongo db as well. and process all dataset and joined them to get a whole.
Then pushed all transformed data to silver folder in a parquet format.


Then created azure synapse account.
created synapse storage (hsg-synapse-storage)
SQL Server admin login - olistuser
#olistsql123
Read listdatastorage from synapse, so give IAM permission role to the adls.
Craete serverless sql pool database. Then in the database from a sql script I retrieve the adls silver file data. Then created a view inside the db 
where i kept all the data here order_status = delivered. now i am ready to serve my data. so created master key encryption. 
wwent through documentation -- Data Migration to Gold Layer (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/sql/develop-tables-cetas)
then finally pushed my data to gold layer.
